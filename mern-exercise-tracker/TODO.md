To do list: 

// New part
* Fix the following bug: edited exercise does now show, seems like exercises are fetched before the update is done saving (shows on refresh)
* Improve modal styling
* Delete user bugs:
    - username does not reset if we leave the page without submitting
    - error handling: selection should be mandatory

// Old
2. Improve error handling (shorter, better way)
3. Navbar UI improvement (hover, active, etc)
