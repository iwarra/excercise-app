To do list: 

// New part
* Fix the following bug: edited exercise does now show, seems like exercises are fetched before the update is done saving (shows on refresh)
* Bug with hovering style for modal buttons (color reset)

// Old
2. Improve error handling (shorter, better way)
3. Navbar UI improvement (hover, active, etc)
